A   prefix  is   an affix which   is placed   before   the  stem of    word.  Particularly  in   the study   of   languages  ,    a   prefix   is   also   called   a   preformative,   because   it  alters  the form of   the word   to which   it   is   affixed.

Prefixes,   like   other   affixes,   can   be either  inflectional,  creating  a new  form  of a word          with the same basic meaning   and   same    lexical category,   or derivational, creating a new word    with a new semantic meaning and   sometimes also a   different   lexical   category  .   Prefixes  ,   like   all   affixes  , are   usually   bound   morphemes.
